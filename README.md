# random-quote-generator
FSJS project 1

This is my first project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree through Treehouse Inc. In this project I created a Random Quote generator. The HTML and CSS for the project were provided, although I tweaked them both slightly in order to create "tags" for the quotes. 

I created an array of quotes for the project. Next, I programmed a getRandomQuote() function to get a random quote from the quote array. The next step was to create a printQuote() function that prints the quote to the page. This function also activates an endSlideShow() and startSlideShow() functions, which start and end an interval of ten seconds before the quote changes to another random quote.

There is also a randomColorPicker() function which picks a random background color for a quote.
